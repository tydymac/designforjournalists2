  <h1>Tyler's food picks for NYC</h1>

<p>
 <a href="http://www.lostacos1.com/">Los Tacos No.1:</a>
  <br>
<p2>This place is good for cheap authentic Mexican tacos which are suprisingly are hard to come by in New York. An added plus, <br> they recently opened a fish taco place right next door to their original spot.</p2>
  <br>
  <br>
<a href="http://pizzalovesemily.com/emmy-squared/"> Emmy Squared Pizza:</a>
  <br>
  <p2>If you ever get sick of "New York" style pizza this place is great. It serves "Detroit" style which <br> is a pan pizza that has crunch cheese along the crust</p2> 
  <br>
    <br>
 <a href="https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/visit/street-of-ships/pioneer/">Ivan Ramen</a>
   <br>
<p2> I am just going to put it out there Ivan Orkin makes the best ramen in NYC. This is also a great spot if you want to <br> eat alone; the counter is very spacious and when it gets busier you get to skip the wait. </p2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a href="https://noodlebar-ny.momofuku.com/">Momofuku Noodle Bar</a><br>
  <p2>It pains me to put this on this list. I am not a fan of David Chang so I hate-eat his food. I do not go here for soup, though. The real <br> winners are the shrimp buns and the spicy lychee slushie. I would go here just for the slushie to be honest. </p2>
    <br>
    <br>
   <a href="http://www.waverlyrestaurant.net/">Waverly Restaurant</a>
  <br>
  <p2> This place is my go to "local" spot. While I don't actually consider myself a local, this place will probably not be on anyone <br> else's "best lists." This is a no fuss dinner in the West Village that is open 24/7. It also probably isn't any better than all <br> the other diners but I love this place. Either get a cheeseburger deluxe or anything on the breakfast menu.

   <a href="http://www.mollyscupcakes.com/ny/pdf/NewYork_Menu_0715.pdf">Molly's Cupcakes</a> <br>
  <p2> I'll be honest I am not a dessert person and if I do eat dessert, it is pie. So when my roommate bought me <br> a "peach cobbler cupcake" from this place I was prepared to be dissappointed but, it was awesome. It is weird and <br>satisfying and really does taste like peach cobbler.

  <br>
    <a href="http://www.vanleeuwenicecream.com/">Van Leeuwen Ice Cream</a><br>
  <p2> I have never actually been to this ice cream shop but I buy at least 4 pints a month of their <br> "passion fruit layer cake" ice cream, so it is basically like I have been there. </p2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://www.ayakokurokawa.com/">Burrow</a><br>
  <p2> I could understand if you have never been to Burrow. I would have never known about it if I hadn't worked in the same <br> building. This is a Japanese pastry shop that my coworkers complain that literally everything is good. My favorites are<br> the matcha madeleine and the foccacia rolls. </p2>
